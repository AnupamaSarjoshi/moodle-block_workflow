Workflow
===============
This document assumes that the reader knows how workflow system works, how to
create workflows and workflow steps, and how to setup email notifications based
on configurable templates.


Finishing steps automatically
-----------------------------
We needed to find a way to automatically notify module teams, 5 days before an
iCMA close date, to go and check the iCMA statistics, and sign-off that the
grading is OK. Then we decided that the best way to do this was to extend the
workflow system so that particular workflow steps can be set up to be automatically
marked as finished.

The advantage of enhancing the workflow system for finishing steps automatically
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. The workflow system is already capable of sending email messages to the
right people based on configurable templates.
b. It will be easy to tell, from the currently active step in the the workflow,
whether the email has been sent or not.
c. To send the email early for any reason (e.g. bank holiday weekend coming up)
an admin can manually go in and finish the step. Similarly, the step can be skipped
if necessary using the Jump feature.
d. This functionality can be useful in other workflows, e.g. doing something
automatically around the time a course start-date. Or if we decided to apply a
workflow to other activities such as wiki, blog, etc, the functionality is
already in place and with a very minor modification can be serving other activities.

How does it work
----------------
On the setp form on 'Automatically finish' there are two select menus,

First one with the options:

10 days before
9 days before
.............
1 day before
do not set (default)
1 day after
...........
9 days after
10 days after

The options of the second select menu depends on the deployment of the workflow.

If the workflow applies to a course, the options are:

Do not automatically finish (default)
the course start date

If the workflow applies to a quiz, the options are:

Do not automatically finish (default)
the quiz open date
the quiz close date

The default setting is:
Automatically finish 'do not set' 'Do not automatically finish'

A typical setting might be:
Automatically finish '5 days before' 'the quiz close date'

Obviously the effect is based on the setting of both select nenus.
NB: If the first select menu is set to 'do not set', the second select menu is
automatically disabled (That is the dafault and means we do not want finish the
current step automatically. In other words, if the first select menu is set to
'n days before' or 'n days after', the second select menu must be set to an option
which has association with some sort of time stamp such as 'the course start date'
or ' the quiz close date'.

How to setup an step to be finished automatically
------------------------------------------------
Under Side administration -> Plugins ->blocks -> workflows
go to the list of workflows (assuming there is at least one workflow on the list)
and choose a workflow by clicking on the view/edit icon which takes you to your
chosen workflow where you can see the workflow settings and the workflow steps.
click on edit step icon to modify a step. In order to automatically finish
the step and set the desired condition as described above.

How does the automatically finish step work
-------------------------------------------------
A cron job will take care of that. I.e. at the site level, the cron functionality
 will check on daily basis whether there are any active steps that are set to
 be finished automatically and if the conditions are met, the steps are automatically
 finished and set to 'completed' and a comment is added to each step indicating
 that this particular step has been completed by the system including date and
 time of finishing the step.

How to run the cron
-------------------
On the acceptance or live server, the cron will be running regularly. The cron
for workflow-automatic-step-finisher is set to run on daily basis between 1 AM
and 7 AM. In other words, if the condition is met and some active steps are
ready to be finished automatically, the action of automatic completion happens
on daily basis.

For testing purposes a functionality has been incorporated to allow users running
the cron at any time, providing the debugging is set. On icmatest server, for
instance, we need to check under

Site administration -> Development -> Debugging

that Debug messages are set to
'DEVELOPER extra Moodle debug messages for developers'.

Then we can run the cron job by going to:
https://icmatest.vledev2.open.ac.uk/vle/admin/cron.php

NB: When going to the above URL, all cron jobs will be executed depending
on their conditions.
